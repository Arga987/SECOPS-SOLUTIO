# React + Vite

These are the following steps you must perform to launch the application

1. Clone the repository using the command git clone "repository link"
repository link - https://github.com/Arga987/SECOPS-SOLUTION-ASSIGNMENT

2. Navigate to the directory cve-project using cd

3. Once you are in the cve-project directory. Run the command "npm install" which will install all the node modules

4. Run the command "npm run dev" which will launch the application on localhost 5173

Note: I have implemented the search functionality which searches based on CVE-ID. If you want to change that, go to cve-project/src/components/Table.jsx/Line 57

Note: I have also implemented the sorting functionality which sorts based on CVSS. By default, it is in ascending order

PS: If it shows any error like props validation or such things.. it's just the eslint type parameters and nothing to worry about

I will also attach a video on how to actually implement it from github repository

Thank you for this opportunity. I truly appreciate the chance to contribute and hope the results meet your expectations. I'm excited to hear your feedback and look forward to the possibility of working together.
